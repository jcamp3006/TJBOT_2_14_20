<h2 "Center"=align>The Bureau of Labor reported, "Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 546,200 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.
The median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $86,320 in May 2018, which was higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $38,640.
"
This can open our eyes to the need for seamless integrated learning that is easy to access and always updated to the latest technologies needed. The growth in innovation only makes this sort of solution more crucial by the minute.</h2>
